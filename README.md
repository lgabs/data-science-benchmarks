# data-science-benchmarks
Benchmark your copmputer with common tasks in Data Science. This project started inspired by [djcunningham0](https://github.com/djcunningham0/m1_benchmarks)'s great work of creating some code to benchmark M1 Macbooks. What I've done was to reorganize the project to serve other MacOS computers, with a simple interface for users to run these benchmarks.
